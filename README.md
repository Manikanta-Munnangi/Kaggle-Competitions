# Kaggle Competitions.
**About Kaggle:**

Itâ€™s a crowd-sourced platform to attract, nurture, train and challenge data scientists from all around the world to solve data science, machine learning and predictive analytics problems. The participants who compete for projects submit their models with a variety of techniques.
All the work is shared on the platform through detailed Kaggle scripts with the intention of inspiring new ideas to achieve better benchmarks. In most Kaggle competitions, submissions are scored immediately and clearly summarised publicly on the live leader-board.
